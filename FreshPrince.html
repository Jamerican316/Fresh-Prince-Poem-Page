		<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
		<div>
			<pre class="main">
            From western Philadelphia I hail
            where in my youth I'd play upon the green
            'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
            by ruffians contemptible and mean.
            Although the spat was trivial and brief,
		    it wounder my dear other deep within;
		    and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
		    she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
		    When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
		    I came upon a coachman most unique;
		    and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
		    despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
		    I survey all the land with princely mien
		    in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.
